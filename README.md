# Image Processor

## Introduction
Welcome to the open-source Image Processor! Image Processor is a scientific image data analysis Software. This software is designed to help researchers efficiently process and analyze scientific image data across various disciplines. With powerful image preprocessing, feature extraction, and data visualization tools, it aims to simplify the process of analyzing images and generating meaningful insights.

## Features

- **Image Preprocessing**: Enhance images by removing noise, adjusting contrast, and more.
- **Feature Extraction**: Detect edges, identify objects, and perform morphological analysis.
- **Image Segmentation**: Segment images using thresholding, edge detection, and other methods.
- **Data Visualization**: Create charts, graphs, and statistical plots to visualize results.
- **Custom Plugin Support**: Extend the software’s functionality with custom plugins for specific needs.
